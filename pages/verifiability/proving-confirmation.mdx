title: 'Anti-Malware Codes: How Voters Can Prove They Confirmed Their Vote'
---

For government elections that require the highest level of security, SIV recommends using a [Voter Authentication and Invitation](/authentication) system based upon sending custom invitations through the postal mail.

On the invitation letter sent to voters, we can add a few random numbers, labeled “Anti Malware Confirmation Codes”. These can be used exclusively for 2nd (or 3rd or 4th) devices used via the [Post Vote-Submission QR Check](/verifiability/detecting-malware) or [Verification #](/verifiability/personal-vote) confirmation methods.

Since these numbers would never be entered onto the first device, there is strong protection even if the first device is infected.

This allows a voter to effectively prove that they did a 2nd device check, without the check being falsely claimed by malware from the first device.

Because the code is only used during a 2nd device check, we can already transfer plenty of uniqueness from the initial device — there does not need to be much entropy in these numbers. A simple two digit number, such as “83” or “15”, should suffice. This makes it quick and easy for the voter to enter it on the 2nd device. It can potentially be valuable to provide a few extras, for 3rd and 4th devices.

Each number should be independently random, unique for each voter, also without duplicates between the devices. The election official such as the clerk or election director would know them, similar to the [Voter Auth Token](/authentication) — they are effectively like additional device Auth Tokens.

When a voter enters them, the election admin server can query whether they are correct for that voter. If they are not, log the error, display a warning, and let them try again.

With this system in place, it now becomes possible to accurately see just how many voters are checking with a second device. It even becomes technically feasible to make such checks mandatory, if desired. Making them required is not necessarily recommended, and voters themselves could still get around it, e.g. by using an incognito window, 2nd browser, or spoofing their user-agent. Nonetheless it becomes very powerful to imagine something like >75% of SIV voters all checking against malware with additional devices.

### Powerful Combination: Anti-Malware Codes + Voter Autonomous Checks + RLA

It would still be useful to perform more thorough randomly sampled audits of the voters as well, confirming in person or over the phone that everything looks good, as an additional audit against this system. These two approaches, voter-autonomous checks & auditor supervised checks, in combination can scale well. The voter-autonomous checks are far easier to get in large numbers, and the supervised checks ensure that voter-autonomous checks are reliable.

### Understanding Risks & Mitigation Options

One vulnerability for these codes is anyone who learns about them from the election admin's servers, or while they are in transit (e.g. postal system). However, this is still an improvement over not having them, because now the attacker needs to compromise both one of those canonical sources, as well as the voter's device.

If desired, it would be possible to display the individual names of voters who have and have not yet checked. This could be very helpful in smaller group settings (e.g. less than 1000), where voters know each other, would want to appear responsible, and would provide reassurance for each other to see that everyone has checked. In certain situations this could be harmful though, such as if less than 100% of voters are expected to check, it could be bad to publish a list of who is consistently _not_ checking, thus becoming more attractive targets for attackers. It would also be counter productive in a setting where people could not be expected to produce a 2nd device, such as an in person event where they may have one smart phone but not much else.

### Review of Anti-Malware Codes

Rather than everyone assuming that others confirmed their vote, Anti-Malware Codes provide a powerful and reliable mechanism, having the voters explicitly confirm that they checked their vote and that it was counted correctly.
