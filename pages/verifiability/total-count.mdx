## A New Level of Transparency In The Counting Process

In SIV elections, the full list of anonymized votes is published at the end of the election, offering a level of transparency not found in traditional paper elections, which only provide vote totals.

With this information easily accessible and with freely available spreadsheet tools, independent recounts are quick and straightforward to conduct.

## Automatic Recounts

In addition, every device that accesses the public election status page automatically conducts its own recount, instantly, creating thousands of independent verifications at no additional cost. Any discrepancies can be discovered quickly for investigation.
