title: Generating Paper Ballots from Digital Votes
---

The SIV Admin software includes a function that automatically converts digital votes into paper ballots in the form of a PDF document. Each generated vote is stamped with a unique Voter Verification #, thus preserving the privacy of the vote.

The ability to generate paper ballots from digital votes allows election administrators to seamlessly integrate SIV votes into their overall collection of votes. Thus, admins can audit and track individual votes, even after the election has concluded.
