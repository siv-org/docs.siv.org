title: How Ukraine can run a safe and provably legitimate election, despite ongoing Russian invasion and occupation
---

_Updated: Tuesday, May 21, 2024_

### Current Status

President Zelensky's 4-year term has now expired.

Due to the ongoing war, martial law is in effect, and elections have been cancelled. The decision cites high risks of physical danger, significant costs, and logistical challenges, particularly given the millions of Ukrainians engaged in the front lines or displaced abroad.

Local polling indicates broad support for Zelensky (approximately 60-80%), but there are important distinctions between informal small-scale polls and legitimate nationwide elections.

There is growing concern, particularly among international allies, about the absence of a plan for democratic elections.

### Proposal Abstract

The [SIV Protocol](https://docs.siv.org/technical-specifications) has been developed to run free and fair elections that can withstand extreme levels of attack, enabling mathematical proof of correctness, using well-vetted computer science and cryptography discoveries.

This protocol has already been used successfully in government-grade elections. It is designed to meet the criteria of (1) Authenticated Voters, (2) Verifiable Results, and (3) Private Voting. It also provides powerful remediation capabilities, and solutions for protecting against authentication attacks, server penetration, vote selling, device malware, and privacy violations.

### Value Of Holding A Free And Fair Election In Ukraine Right Now

**Ukrainians**: Holding an election preserves their democratic voice, confirms their leadership's legitimacy, and can re-energize the population to keep fighting for their freedom.

**The Zelensky Administration**: It reinforces its legitimacy, demonstrates its commitment to democratic principles, and continues to gain international support, including justified financial support from other democracies who want to maintain Ukraine's democracy.

**Pro-Democracy Allies**: It reinforces global support for democratic practices, shows the value of democratic values even in hardship, and strengthens international solidarity.

**Russian Army and Citizens**: It provides proof of the Kremlin's false narrative, showing that Ukrainians reject the idea of needing "liberation" by Russia and desire independence. This action undermines the very justification for Russia's invasion. By successfully holding a free and fair election, Ukraine exemplifies resilience and a steadfast commitment to democracy, highlighting the unjust nature of Russia's actions.

### What SIV Solves

**1. Safety**: Ensure the protection of voters and election administrators by eliminating the need for in-person voting infrastructure, which is especially hard-to-defend in an active war zone.

**2. Accessibility**: Enable participation for all Ukrainians, including those on the front lines and abroad, to uphold the legitimacy of the election.

**3. Cost**: Optimize budget allocation by focusing on fighting expenditures while maintaining election integrity.

**4. Strong Verifiability of Election Integrity**: This proposal aims to offer a strongly verifiable election where voters and independent parties can verify for themselves that the election is legitimate and that the results are legitimate.

### How To Run A Provably Legitimate Election During War

The following is an outline of how to run an election with the highest-grade security and auditability. Each section links to in-depth explanations for those looking to understand the system thouroughly. If you want to go directly in-depth you can visit [docs.siv.org](https://docs.siv.org) or [review the technical specification](https://docs.siv.org/technical-specifications).

#### Authentication

Authentication ensures that only registered voters can cast a ballot and that each voter can only vote once.

Each voter receives a unique Voter Authentication Token, a short hexadecimal number, via postal mail. Alternatively, this code can be given in-person, sent via SMS, secure digital channels like Signal Messenger, or email. Security is maintained regardless of the delivery method, as voters have full verifiability and election administrators have auditable remediation powers.

Multiple authentication methods can be layered on top of sending codes via postal mail to achieve the highest grade of security:

1. Drawn signature verification
1. ID + selfie photos
1. IP address geolocation
1. Time-based One-Time Passwords
1. Pre-distributed Cryptographic Public Key Pairs

One relevant capability is that election administrators can revoke voter credentials at any stage of the election, including after voting and tallying. This process leaves an extensive written trail and cannot be secretly abused.

This is possible because encrypted votes, still linked to voter's identities, can be corrected at any point. Then the updated set can continue to be re-anonymized and re-tallied as necessary.

#### Verifiability

The SIV protocol is designed as Zero-Trust, meaning no one needs to trust the SIV team, the election administrators, or any servers for the legitimacy of the election.

##### 1. Voters personally verify their vote was accurately recorded

When a voter casts a vote, their device generates a unique Verification Number. At the end of the election, a list of all encrypted votes is published without voter identities. The voter uses this number to verify if their vote was counted accurately in the final tally.

If the vote is incorrect, the voter notifies the election administrator to re-submit their selections.

**Example of how Verification # work:**

_After casting votes:_

  style={{ width: '50%' }}
  className='ml-5 shadow-lg shadow-sky-900/30 my-7'
/>

_Once encrypted list is published by the election admin:_

<img
  src='/images/verification-num-list.png'
  style={{ width: '50%' }}
  className='ml-5 mb-20 shadow-lg shadow-sky-900/30 my-7'
/>

###### Additional Manual & Analog Verification

Verifying election results on a personal device can be vulnerable to malware or other security threats, compromising accuracy. Instead, voters can perform manual verification by double-checking with other people's devices or using paper printouts. Although using such manual verification may seem more time-consuming, a few people verifying this way can calibrate digital verification methods.

##### 2. Verify Total Vote Count

The full list of anonymized votes is published at the end of the election, offering a great level of transparency. With this information easily accessible and with freely available spreadsheet tools, independent recounts are quick and straightforward to conduct.

##### 3. Using Multiple Devices to Detect Malware

Voters can use a second or multiple devices with independent malware profiles, such as different operating systems, to confirm their selections. This can be initiated right at the time of voting, without waiting for election results to be unlocked.

These checks can be done in seconds, as quickly as scanning a QR code. No special knowledge is needed.

Additionally, election administrators can maintain a record of device types that successfully pass a 2nd Device Check, allowing election-wide trends to be identified.

##### 4. Zero-Knowledge Proofs As Mathematical Proof Against Tampering

SIV uses multiple Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to prove that an election is correctly conducted, that every vote was counted, and it all added up to one person winning with a particular total.

→ [Comprehensive documentation on ZKPs](https://docs.siv.org/verifiability/zero-knowledge)

##### 5. Risk Limiting Audits

RLAs involve randomly sampling ballots and verifying their correctness to statistically confirm the overall accuracy of the election results.

The process is efficient and scalable, requiring only a small sample size to achieve high confidence levels. For example, in a tightly contested election, sampling a small fraction of votes can provide over 99% confidence that the results are accurate.

RLAs allow for verification without compromising voter privacy and can be conducted swiftly and transparently.

##### 6. Anti-Malware Codes: How Voters Can Prove They Confirmed Their Vote

The vote invitation letter sent to voters can include a few random numbers labeled as "Anti-Malware Confirmation Codes." These codes will be exclusively used for 2nd (or 3rd or 4th) devices utilized for Post Vote-Submission QR or Verification # confirmation methods. By using these codes, voters can effectively prove that they did a 2nd device check, without the check being falsely claimed by malware from the first device. Since these numbers would never be entered onto the first device, there is strong protection even if the first device is infected.

The combination of voter-autonomous checks (Verification # Check & 2nd Device QR Code Check), and auditor-supervised checks (RLAs) can be scaled effectively to enhance the security of the auditing process.

##### 7. Remediating Compromised Votes

If a voter detects a tampered vote using any verification method, election administrators can invalidate the vote and allow the voter to submit a new one. This can happen at any stage of the election.

This process necessitates written documentation, in which the voter explicitly requests their vote to be revoked, ensuring a comprehensive audit trail.

→ [Comprehensive documentation on Remediation](https://docs.siv.org/verifiability/remediating-compromised-votes)

#### Privacy

For a truly "Free and Fair Election", voters must be able to make their choices freely, without anyone learning how they voted, including election officials and technology providers.

SIV is built upon Multi-Party Encryption and Verifiable Cryptographic Shuffles to ensure that no one, including election administrators and SIV infrastructure, can see how anyone else votes. At a high level, SIV ensures vote privacy by:

**a.** Using strong encryption to lock votes inside sealed digital encryption before submission.

**b.** Shuffling up the encrypted votes many times for strong anonymization, by multiple independent parties, named "Privacy Protectors". This design creates multiple fail-safes. Even if some Privacy Protectors' devices are compromised, vote privacy can still be protected. Privacy Protectors do not need to trust each other, and thanks to strong cryptographic proofs, cannot possibly tamper with votes.

**c.** Only after the votes have been thoroughly anonymized, the Privacy Protectors unlock the encryption and verifiably tally up the final results.

#### Approach to Attacks

One of the main security approaches for ensuring a provably legitimate election is to enable everyone to notice attacks and allow election administrators to quickly and audibly remediate any tampered votes.

SIV does not claim to be bullet-proof. However, it enables numerous verification methods and remediation capabilities at any point in the election process.

One of the powerful features of the SIV Protocol is that it not only allows voters to personally check for tampering but also provides mathematical proof against hacking, tampering, cheating, or foul play.

Such approach will create a glass-window into the legitimacy of the Ukrainan election.

**Examples of Attacks & Mitigation Strategies:**

#### Malware on Device

The SIV protocol acknowledges that malware will always be a concern, and it focuses on providing mechanisms to identify and rectify such corruptions.

1. Voters can personally verify their vote, even without the need for a computer, ensuring accurate tabulation.

2. Multiple-Device Verification: Voters can use secondary devices with different malware profiles to verify their vote quickly and easily.

3. Risk Limiting Audits: Facilitating efficient RLAs by allowing 3rd parties to check if voters verified their vote, ensuring high statistical confidence even in close elections.

4. Remediation Abilities: Preliminary results allow for a challenge period where voters can check and report discrepancies, enabling vote revocation and recalculations as necessary.

#### Authentication Attacks

The SIV system permits the revocation of voter credentials at any stage of the election, including post-voting and tallying phases. Because of this, even in cases where credentials are compromised, remedial action remains feasible.

This protocol replicates existing voting methods, such as the use of unique codes distributed via postal mail. And it also enables integration of additional authentication techniques, including verified email delivery, SMS, drawn e-signatures, time-based one-time passwords, IP address geolocation, government ID photos, and cryptographic key pairs.

### Opportunity to enable current democratic frameworks to combat future authoritarianism

This provably legitimate voting protocol, SIV, offers a unique advantage: once the infrastructure is established, it becomes reusable even under an anti-democratic government. This is akin to planting good seeds before a government transitions from democratic to dictatorship, making it significantly easier to maintain a democracy in the long run.

Such effort would magnify our current actions into the future, enabling current democratic frameworks to combat future authoritarianism.

SIV is a democratic technology, a weapon against future anti-democratic efforts. Implementing it now ensures that, regardless of the outcome of the upcoming election or the war, the Ukrainian people will be equipped to sustain democracy on the current scale. Such common knowledge of one another's will ensures a continuous common understanding of everyone's choices—a type of knowledge that has historically proved to weaken dictatorships to the point of collapse.

This moment is pivotal opportunity for establishing a long-term, advanced democracy in Ukraine, leveraging the most advanced tools to serve the people fairly and reliably.
