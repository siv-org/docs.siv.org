### Current Status

President Zelensky's 4-year term has now expired.

Due to the ongoing war, martial law is in effect, and elections have been cancelled. The decision cites high risks of physical danger, significant costs, and logistical challenges, particularly given the millions of Ukrainians engaged in the front lines or displaced abroad.

Local polling indicates broad support for Zelensky (approximately 60-80%), but there are important distinctions between informal small-scale polls and legitimate nationwide elections.

There is growing concern, particularly among international allies, about the absence of a plan for democratic elections.

### Proposal Abstract

The [SIV Protocol](https://docs.siv.org/technical-specifications) has been developed to run free and fair elections that can withstand extreme levels of attack, enabling mathematical proof of correctness, using well-vetted computer science and cryptography discoveries.

This protocol has already been used successfully in government-grade elections. It is designed to meet the criteria of (1) [Authenticated Voters](/authentication), (2) [Verifiable Results](/verifiability), and (3) [Private Voting](/privacy). It also provides powerful [remediation capabilities](/verifiability/remediating-compromised-votes), and solutions for protecting against [authentication attacks](/mitigating-attacks/authentication), [server penetration](/mitigating-attacks/server-penetration), [vote selling](/research-in-progress/vote-sellers-dilemma), [device malware](/mitigating-attacks/malware), and [privacy violations](/mitigating-attacks/privacy).

### The Power of Free and Fair Elections in Ukraine

**For the Ukrainian People**: Holding an election amplifies Ukrainians' voices and democratic legitimacy, and can invigorate everyone to keep fighting for freedom.

**For the Zelensky Administration**: Free and fair elections reaffirm their mandate, demonstrate commitment to democratic principles, and attract greater international aid from other supportive democracies.

**For Pro-Democracy Allies**: Witnessing a fair election strengthens global stability and reinforces democratic values worldwide.

**For a Pro-Russia Audience**: It provides evidence about the official Russian narrative claiming the Ukrainian people desire liberation. The Kremlin claims the Zelensky administration is corrupt and illegitimate: "We are not carrying out aggression against the Ukrainian people, but against the group that seized power in Kyiv." By successfully holding a free and fair election, 30 million Ukrainians can directly respond to this stated justification for the "Special Military Operation".

### What SIV Solves

**1. Safety**: Ensure the protection of voters and election administrators by greatly reducing the need for in-person voting infrastructure, which is especially hard-to-defend in an active war zone.

**2. Accessibility**: Enable participation for all Ukrainians, including those on the front lines and abroad, to uphold the legitimacy of the election.

**3. Cost**: Optimize budget allocation by focusing on fighting expenditures while maintaining election integrity.

**4. Strong Verifiability of Election Integrity**: This proposal aims to offer a strongly verifiable election where voters and independent parties can verify for themselves that the election is legitimate and that the results are legitimate.

### Opportunity to enable current democratic frameworks to combat future authoritarianism

This provably legitimate voting protocol, SIV, offers a unique advantage: once the infrastructure is established, it becomes reusable even under an anti-democratic government. This is akin to planting good seeds before a government transitions from democratic to dictatorship, making it significantly easier to maintain a democracy in the long run.

Such effort would magnify our current actions into the future, enabling current democratic frameworks to combat future authoritarianism.

SIV is a democratic technology, a weapon against future anti-democratic efforts. Implementing it now ensures that, regardless of the outcome of the upcoming election or the war, the Ukrainian people will be equipped to sustain democracy on the current scale. Such common knowledge of one another's will ensures a continuous common understanding of everyone's choicesâ€”a type of knowledge that has historically proved to weaken dictatorships to the point of collapse.

This moment is pivotal opportunity for establishing a long-term, advanced democracy in Ukraine, leveraging the most advanced tools to serve the people fairly and reliably.
