title: How Ukraine can run a safe and provably legitimate election, despite ongoing Russian invasion and occupation
---

### The Current Situation

President Zelensky's original 4-year term has now expired. Because of the war, there is currently martial law. Elections have been cancelled, citing in part high risks of physical danger, costs, and logistical challenges, especially with a signficant percentage of the Ukrainian population away fighting or fled abroad.

Local polling suggests broad support for Zelensky (eg. 60-80%), but there are number of important differences between small-scale informal polling and legitimate nationwide elections. There is growing concern, especially from international allies, about a lack of a plan for democratic elections.

### The Value Of Holding A Free And Fair Election In Ukraine Right Now

**Ukrainians**: Holding an election preserves their democratic voice, confirms their leadership's legitimacy, and re-energize the population to keep fighting for their freedom.

**The Zelensky Administration**: It reinforces its legitimacy, demonstrates its commitment to democratic principles, and continues to gain international support, including justified financial support from other democracies who want to maintain Ukraine's democracy.

**Pro-Democracy Allies**: It reinforces global support for democracy, shows the value of democratic values even in hardship, and strengthens international solidarity.

**The Russian Army and Citizens**: It provides proof of the Kremlin's false narrative, showing that Ukrainians reject the idea of needing "liberation" by Russia and desire independence. This action undermines the very justification for Russia's invasion. By successfully holding a free and fair election, Ukraine exemplifies resilience and a steadfast commitment to democracy, highlighting the unjust nature of Russia's actions.

### A 21st-Century Approach for Even More Secure and Accessible Elections

For the last few years, we at [SIV.org](https://siv.org) have been developing secure infrastructure for vastly more accessible and tamper-resistent democratic elections, and have run a number of successful government-grade elections in the United States.

When we learned about the unique challenges Ukraine was facing, we asked ourselves if we could contribute to help address the problems.

Although some unique new pieces are needed, that vast majority of our secure voting infrastructure is ready and we believe could greatly help Ukraine.

### Unique Benefits

**1. Safety**: Ensure the protection of voters and election administrators by eliminating the need for in-person voting infrastructure, which is especially hard-to-defend in an active war zone.

**2. Accessibility**: Enable participation for all Ukrainians, including those on the front lines and abroad, to uphold the legitimacy of the election.

**3. Cost**: Optimize budget allocation by focusing on fighting expenditures while maintaining election integrity.

**4. Strong Verifiability of Election Integrity**: This proposal aims to offer a strongly verifiable election where voters and independent parties can verify for themselves that the election is legitimate and that the results are legitimate.

### Deadlines

Although the current situation is highly dynamic, and there are no explicitly hard deadlines, there are two key reasons to act with urgency:

1. Before the new status quo of no-elections ossifies in place.
2. Before Russia gains a new propaganda victory that Ukraine is ruled by a tyrant, refusing to hold elections.

### A Provably Legitimate Election

The following is an outline for how to run a free and fair election that can withstand extreme levels of attack, enabling active proof of correctness, using well-vetted computer science discoveries.

We have named this voting protocol 'Secure Internet Voting', SIV for short.

The voting architecture proposed below is especially beneficial for situations requiring the highest-grade of security and auditability, ideal in war circumstances.

#### Authentication

The first security requirement to address is “Who are the Ukrainian people who can vote? How do we identify them and make sure that only one vote is cast per legitimate Ukrainian?”. The following methods can ensure that only legitimate voters can vote and only once:

Unique voter authentication codes sent:

- via postal mail
- given in person

#### Verifiability

Setting up systems that provide mathematical proofs against hacking, tampering, cheating, or foul play.

#### Privacy

Protecting voters from a hostile, anti-democratic government, or from a government that punishes opposition. Prevents people from being attacked or pressured into a decision.

## Opportunity for a “Rising from the Ashes” moment

SIV has this one unique special property which is that if you set up the infrastructure once, it becomes re-usable, even in the face of an anti-democratic govt. So you can kind of think of it as planting the seeds and then as long as you plant the seeds before the govt converts from democratic to anti-democratic, it remains vastly easier to maintain democracy. This multiplies all our effort right now into the future. It allows current democracy to fight future authoritarianism. It's a democratic technology / weapon for the future / for future democratic efforts. Doing it now, allows for no matter who wins this election and no matter who wins the war militarily, the Ukrainian people will already be set up to continue practicing democracy on the 30M people scale. There can always be a common knowledge of what the Ukrainian people will want. And throughout histories when common knowledge is wide in the open, dictatorships have become very fragile to the point of immediate collapse.

Like in the case of Estonia when it was re-building from Soviet invasion, this moment can be pivotal in setting up for a long-term democracy, and even more…setting up for the most advanced democracy there is, employing the latest tools to serve the people fairly and reliably.

"Necessity is the mother of invention."
