The implementation of Secure Internet Voting (SIV) offers a means by which voters can easily and efficiently verify the accuracy of their own vote and independently recount the votes, thereby providing vastly stronger assurance that the election is fair and accurate.

In contrast to traditional paper-based voting methods, SIV provides greater verifiability by publishing the list of results while preserving the confidentiality of individual voter selections.

Moreover, the design of SIV is based on positive proof, meaning that the chances of detecting any malicious or corrupt activities are greatly increased, rather than solely relying on the absence of reported issues.
