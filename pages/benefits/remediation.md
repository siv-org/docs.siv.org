Unlike paper elections, SIV allows votes to be revoked, with sufficient justification, at any point, even after anonymization & tallying, for powerful unprecedented levels of remediation and flexibility in the voting process.

With paper ballots, courts have only crude and limited tools to address alleged election irregularity, such as throwing out the count from an entire precinct or county, or calling for a new election.

Because SIV is able to preserve all data at every step along the way, a court facing a claim of election irregularities is now empowered with far greater and flexible precision to correct or rollback elections exactly as needed.

One analogy is the difference between writing on a classical typewriter vs modern digital writing tools, which offer a simple backspace key.
