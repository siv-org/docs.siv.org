SIV allows for a significant increase in the speed and efficiency of the voting process. Voters are able to cast their ballots and receive near instantaneous confirmation of receipt, whereas traditional paper-based methods would require a significant time lag for the mailing and return of physical ballots.

This drastically accelerates the entire voting process and provides voters with the immediate satisfaction of knowing that their vote has been received and acknowledged.
