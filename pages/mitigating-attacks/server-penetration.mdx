title: Server Penetration Attacks
---

The SIV Protocol is designed so that nobody needs to trust election servers for accurate results or confidentiality.

**Complete Verifiability**

All [results are completely verifiable](/verifiability) and any mistakes can be independently detected. This provides far greater assurance than traditional election infrastructure where tallying is done behind closed doors.

**Auditable Evidence**

Written auditable evidence is available for successful completion of each of the [5 steps of the SIV Protocol](/technical-specifications#election-begins). Each and every step can and should be independently checked and verified to justify as much confidence in election outcomes as possible.

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs**

SIV has developed [Zero-Knowledge Proofs](/verifiability/zero-knowledge) that provide verification against tampered election results. These proofs only need to be run once, rather than requiring all voters to verify.

**Comparison to Paper**

In both paper-only elections and Secure Internet Voting, compromising election administrators or their computers could lead to inaccurate results being published. Although both share this vulnerability, SIV makes it much harder for these types of inaccuracies to pass undetected.
