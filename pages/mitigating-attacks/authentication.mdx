title: Voter Authentication Attacks
---

The SIV Protocol is purposefully designed to be adaptable with regard to voter authentication methods, allowing each jurisdiction and election to tailor the process according to their specific requirements. SIV is capable of replicating existing voting protocols, such as the use of unique codes distributed via postal mail or provided in person.

Essentially, SIV's authentication can be as robust as, if not more so than, traditional paper-based methods. Moreover, it allows for the integration of supplementary authentication techniques, including verified email delivery, SMS, drawn e-signatures, time-based one-time passwords, IP address geolocation, government ID photos, and cryptographic key pairs.

The entire SIV voter authentication process is designed to facilitate independent auditability.

Additionally, the system permits the revocation of voter credentials at any stage of the election, including post-voting and tallying phases. Because of this, even in cases where credentials are compromised, remedial action remains feasible.

It is important to note that such capabilities are unavailable in paper elections. SIV's innovative approach offers election administrators and legal court orders a powerful, precise remediation toolkit, eliminating the need for unfair precinct-wide vote discarding or costly re-elections.
