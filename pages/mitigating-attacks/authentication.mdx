title: Voter Authentication Attacks
---

The SIV Protocol is intentionally flexible about voter authentication methods. The specific process is up to each jurisdiction's and election's requirements.

SIV can recreate the existing voting protocols, such as requiring unique codes sent via postal mail or given out in person.

In other words, SIV's authentication can be at least as strong as existing paper approaches.

But we can also layer additional authentication methods, such as verified email delivery, SMS, drawn e-signatures, time-based one-time passwords, IP address geolocation, photos of government ID, or using cryptographic key pairs.

Importantly, the entire SIV voter authentication process should be independently auditable.

Additionally, all voter credentials can be revoked at any point of the election, including after voting and tallying. This means even if credentials are compromised, the issue can still be fixed.

Note that this is simply not possible with paper elections. It opens up powerful new precision remediation abilities for election administrators and legal court orders, who currently can only unfairly throw out entire precinct's votes or expensively require a new election.
