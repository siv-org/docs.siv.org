There are many reasons this potential attack should not justify withholding Secure Internet Voting from citizens:

<div style={{ marginLeft: 30}}>
a. SIV itself can be installed onto the election administratorâ€™s domain, so that it is only offered behind easily identifiable .gov domain addresses.

b. In the physical world, this is already an issue with fake ballot drop-boxes and ballot harvesting rings. The answer in these cases is education, clear communication from the election administrators, and criminal prosecution where necessary. The same applies with digital voting.

c. Currently spoofing/phishing is a risk with any digital service such as e-commerce websites, fake banking websites, fake crowdfunding websites, etc. Sadly, it does happen. But this is not sufficient justification to prohibit online services altogether.

d. Even if a voter casts a vote on a fraudulent service, they can still cast their vote on the legitimate service. If a voter has registered their email address or phone number with their election administrator, the admins can easily send follow-up reminders that an official vote still has not been received yet.

e. Even if election administrators do not offer Secure Internet Voting as an additional option, fraudulent actors can still set up fake voting websites and trick especially vulnerable voters.

f. It is important to work to mitigate the number of votes lost because voters fall prey to fraudulent vote collection. However, let us also consider how many votes are not being cast right now in elections with only paper options. It's not hard to imagine significantly more votes cast with the additional accessibility of quick and easy voting from our own mobile devices.

g. SIV is not meant as the only voting option. Voters that do not feel comfortable with digital methods can continue to use the paper-voting options they are familiar with.
