Delivering reliable services at scale is an issue to take very seriously. Fortunately, there now have been decades of proven experiences delivering trillions of dollars of economic value to billions of people online. This includes both the private sector and government services, such as communicating with each other, financial trading, paying taxes, and many more examples.

Here are some of the ways SIV can mitigate Denial-of-Service attacks:

<div style={{ marginLeft: 30}}>
a. The core SIV architecture is built for high scale, with extremely light-weight clients and limited resources needed from backend servers, all of which can scale both vertically and horizontally.

b. SIV is designed to allow outsourcing the public-facing resources to Content Delivery Networks, who have the expertise of successfully serving billions of users daily, even in the face of hostile attacks. These can be leveraged without compromising SIV's fundamental security for running elections with strong integrity and privacy.

c. SIV can utilize multiple redundancies in infrastructure. The "Chaos Engineering" approach popularized by Netflix is a well-established method to pre-emptively diagnose and resolve any points of infrastructure vulnerability.

d. Because SIV is authenticated, there is always the option to rate-limit abusive users and IP addresses.

Our critical election systems must be handled responsibly. It is clear to us that when significant numbers of voters try to use a system at the same time, while hostile actors are also attacking with DoS traffic, unreliability can create fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Therefore, our attitude is to scale slowly and intentionally, with clear expectations for what load the system is ready to handle, with explicit contingencies in place.

If we are to compare SIV with paper options, then we must take into consideration that even in the best of times, in-person voting options are only available during limited daytime hours, typically something like 8am - 7pm. Online options, on the other hand, can easily be offered 24 hours a day, without compromising security.

Additionally, we must consider that existing in-person and vote-by-mail options are also subject to availability challenges, whether intentionally, such as the Fall 2020 allegations of U.S. Postal Service sabotage, or acts of nature, such as pandemics that disrupt in-person voting.

Fundamentally, Secure Internet Voting is now orders of magnitude cheaper to securely power elections than in-person or vote-by-mail. So while all of these options can face threats to their normal operations, it is valuable to further develop trustworthy and widely available internet voting options.

In the end, SIV is only an additional option. We are not advocating for replacing existing in-person or postal-mail options, only adding onto them for people who want to use such service.

We must be proactive about defending against Denial of Service attacks. But let us not preemptively completely deny the service of Secure Internet Voting from voters, simply because there is a future possibility of it being temporarily denied.
