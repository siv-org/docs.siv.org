title: Malware on Voter’s Device
---

SIV does not assume malware will never exist. Instead, it offers the ability to detect and correct such corruptions.

Unlike in paper elections, voters can verify, without requiring a computer, that their vote is counted as intended. This can create an outcome that is far more credible to all voters, because it does not depend upon the integrity of any backroom counting process. It enables voters to personally confirm their voice is being heard accurately.

When comparing Secure Internet Voting with paper elections, we must start with the fact that paper elections are themselves not entirely immune to malware attacks and require verification too. For example, the computer that publishes the results of the election can be infected by malware. It is not that this problem is eliminated in paper or digital elections, but the questions to ask ourselves are “Is it possible to detect such corruption? And how difficult is it to detect?”. SIV’s advantage is that this verification becomes available and easy for voters too, not just election administrators with privileged access.

SIV has multiple checkpoints where this type of attack can be mitigated. In chronological order:

**1. Don’t Opt-In**

SIV is meant as an additional voting option. If people do not want to take responsibility for verifying their vote (using methods 2 or 3) they can continue with paper voting.

**2. 2nd-Device Check** SIV enables a voter to easily use a 2nd device to verify their vote was submitted as intended. Separate devices with independent malware profiles, such as a different operating system, provide extra layers of defense.

These checks can be done in seconds, as quickly as scanning a QR code and with as many additional devices as desired. No special knowledge is needed.

**3. After votes are tallied and publicly published, there are two more powerful mitigation checks possible.**

**A.** Voters personally verify that their vote is in the final tally.

Unlike all the other checks which require a computer, this check does not necessarily need a device in order to be successfully completed.

The voter can check the results using their Voter Verification Number. This is a unique number for them that was generated on their device, inside their encryption envelope, and it is published alongside the contents of their vote, after the voting period ends.

As preliminary results would now be published, voters whose favorite candidate lost now have a strong incentive to check and confirm if their vote was correctly casted and counted.

**B.** Election administrators can conduct Risk-Limiting Audits.

A relatively small sampling size can be selected and official representatives can follow up with a random sample to walk them through the steps of confirming that their vote was not tampered with or lost as a result of malware. This process can still be done without compromising the individual voter’s privacy.

The nature of Risk Limiting Audit math scales extremely nicely. As a real-world data example, the Georgia 2020 Presidential Race had a final vote tally of 2,473,633 for Joe Biden, 2,461,854 for Donald Trump, 49.47% (Biden) to 49.24% (Trump). This requires compromising only 0.12% of votes to flip the outcome: half (5889) of the 11,779 difference. Despite this razor thin margin, examining only 5,000 randomly sampled votes out of the 4,999,958 total cast (about 1 in 700) can provide 99.72% confidence that the final winner was correct. Doubling the amount checked to 10,000 out of the approximately 5,000,000 total votes cast results in 99.9992% confidence in correct outcomes.

It is important to note that the published results should initially be preliminary. There should be a sufficient challenge period for voters to carry out all checks and raise any issues if they believe their vote was compromised. Even at this late stage, thanks to the capabilities of a SIV election, votes can still be revoked and new tallies can still be performed, all while maintaining a written audit trail and preserving voter privacy.

These checks conducted by voters themselves have the power to strengthen the trust and transparency in each election process.
