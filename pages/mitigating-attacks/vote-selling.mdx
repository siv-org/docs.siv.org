title: Vote Selling
---

In this section, we will explore multiple arguments on the current status of vote selling and propose a potential solution.

## The Status Quo Is Already Coercible

1. Mail-in ballots can be easily coerced in person by spouses, bosses, or religious congregation leaders, who can simply ask the voter to sign a blank ballot and hand it over.
1. Both mail-in and in-person voting are vulnerable to smartphone video recording proofs, which can be used to confirm a vote has been cast in a certain way. It is difficult for voting facilities to detect and enforce against this practice.
1. Elected representatives are already susceptible to coercion through bribes or indirect "revolving door" appointments, which can have a far more significant impact on constituents than a single coerced vote (e.g. one representative sells out all their constituents, approx. one million in the case of a US Congressional Rep, compared to a single voter selling their vote).

## Voter Coercion Is Currently A Theoretical Problem

1. According to [The Federal Voting Assistance Program](https://www.fvap.gov/) there are approx. 4.8 millions US voters abroad, including military personnel. Such voters already submit votes through plaintext email attachments, with no evidence of widespread vote buying or selling.
1. There is a lack of clarity regarding the market value of a vote and no concrete evidence that vote buying or selling is currently occurring.
1. If Secure Internet Voting were to enable widespread coercion, it could always be repealed and replaced with paper-only voting systems.

## Existing Laws And Their Implications

1. Current laws impose strong criminal penalties for both briber and bribee, including imprisonment, fines, and the potential loss of voting rights. This has already been in the US criminal code for over 70 years [18 U.S.C. ยง597](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2020-title18/html/USCODE-2020-title18-partI-chap29-sec597.htm&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1673928068116540&usg=AOvVaw1-AAyNYclRb7Bj1iYXTVbb), carrying up to 2 years jail time and a $10k fine for a single willful instance, for both buyer & seller.

1. The phenomenon of competing bribes could potentially neutralize each other's influence on voters. For instance, if a voter is offered $50 to vote for Candidate A and $35 for Candidate B, the net financial incentive favoring Candidate A over B is a mere $15. Consequently, the corrupting effect may be less significant than it initially seems, especially when considering the inherent risks associated with engaging in such activities, which include the possibility of being caught and facing legal consequences.

## Tradeoff With Verification

There is a fundamental trade-off between receipt-freeness and verifiability in digital voting systems.

MACI is a common example given as a potential solution. However, MACI prioritize coercion resistance over verification against on-device malware or vote privacy. This tradeoff raises questions about which value should be prioritized.

Thousands of voters, candidates, and election officials have been consulted on this matter, and the prevailing consensus is a strong preference for verifiability. This preference demonstrates the value placed on significant improvements in the election process, even if it comes at the expense of receipt-freeness.

## Political Promises & Their Monetary Value

Politicians often make promises that have specific monetary value to voters, such as free healthcare, student debt forgiveness, or industry subsidies. Such promises often come as "Vote for me and you will get X". This practice can be viewed as a form of vote buying, yet is widely accepted within the political process.

## Potential Solution

Following the current legal solution to criminalize vote selling, SIV developed a potential legal solution that addresses vote selling while preserving voter verifiability named ["Vote Sellers Dilemma"](/further-areas/vote-sellers-dilemma).

This method rewards the defector (seller or buyer) who reports the vote selling or buying proposition. As a result, the trust between the two parties is destroyed, given the heightened likelihood of one party betraying the other in pursuit of the offered reward.
