title: Further Research in Progress
---

Although Secure Internet Voting is [already more secure than existing options](/compare), our team has ongoing research in progress to further strengthen different aspects of SIV:

- [Vote Seller's Dilemma](/research-in-progress/vote-sellers-dilemma)

- [Automated Reward](/research-in-progress/automated-reward): using Smart Contracts for additional financial guarantees of vote integrity

- From ["Verifying Observers"](/verifiability/verifying-observers) to ["Privacy Protectors"](/research-in-progress/privacy-protectors): making it easy for citizens to become Privacy Protector, instead of election officials having the burden to pick a few Verifying Observers

- [Highly Redundant Real-time Data Backups](/research-in-progress/data-backups)

- [Information Theoretic Security: Quantum-Resistant Cryptography](/research-in-progress/information-theoretic-security)

- Air-gapping Voter interface
