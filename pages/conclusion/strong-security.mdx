title: Are computers inherently less secure than paper?
---

Computers can be used for much stronger security than analog options, and already power much of our political, military, and economic infrastructure.

The US House of Representatives has cast all their public votes using electronic voting equipment since 1973. Before this, a single vote took 30 minutes; now it takes seconds.

The US nuclear arsenal is secured by strong multi-party cryptography, and communication from command centers to the front lines goes over digital channels, secured by strong encryption.

Millions of Americans have adopted online banking. In a single day, the NASDAQ Stock Exchange sees hundreds of billions of dollars of trading volume.

As of January 2023, the collective cryptocurrency algorithms currently represent almost 1 trillion of market value, secured by nothing more than secret integers on individual devices â€” and with no reversibility, unlike SIV.

Many people clearly prefer online options. It's easy to imagine many would likewise prefer internet voting, especially once shown how it can be even more secure than paper alternatives.
