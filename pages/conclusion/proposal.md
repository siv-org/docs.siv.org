**SIVâ€™s mission is to offer citizens the power of nearly instantaneous, personally verifiable, and private voting, on any preferred devices, at a fraction of the cost of current election systems.**

In the past, many have doubted the ability to conduct secure elections online, but with the advancements in technology and security measures, it has now become a viable option.

The strong cryptography currently used to safeguard national secrets and armaments, can now be used to create a secure election system with no single point of vulnerability, and with methods in place to easily detect and remediate any attempts of attack.

We can start by conducting pilot elections on a small scale, thus we can identify and address any issues that may arise in a controlled environment, before a full-scale deployment of the system. Additionally, it will also give the opportunity to showcase the end-to-end process from the voter's experience, the registrar's management, to the vote tally and results.

SIV has the power to greatly improve the voting process and make democracy more accessible to more citizens.

It is of great importance to evaluate and consider new possibilities before dismissing them outright. Without examination and experimentation, one cannot truly understand the potential benefits and drawbacks of a particular innovation or solution. Therefore, it is essential that before rejecting a new concept or idea, people test and evaluate it through pilot programs and trials. This allows to properly assess its feasibility and potential impact.

Only by engaging in this process can one make an informed decision and avoid premature dismissal of potentially transformative and valuable innovations, such as a **voter-verifiable election system** that provides proofs of correctness or corruption and is easily accessible to every citizen.
