title: Are computers inherently less secure than paper?
---

While computers are often presented in the media as inherently less secure than traditional paper methods, the reality is that they can provide much stronger security measures, already powering much of our political, military, and economic infrastructure.

Since 1973, the US House of Representatives has relied on electronic voting equipment for all their public votes. What used to take 30 minutes now merely takes seconds. Similarly, the SIV system aims to offer citizens even more powerful technology of nearly instantaneous, personally verifiable, and private voting on any preferred devices, all at a fraction of the cost of current election systems.

The US nuclear arsenal is secured by strong multi-party cryptography, and communication from command centers to the front lines goes over digital channels, secured by strong encryption.

Furthermore, millions of Americans have adopted online banking. In a single day, the NASDAQ Stock Exchange sees hundreds of billions of dollars of trading volume.

Therfore, the technology that can secure a nation's nuclear arsenal and facilitate billions of dollars in daily trades, we now implemented it to secure our democratic process too.

As of January 2023, the collective cryptocurrency algorithms currently represent almost 1 trillion of market value, secured by nothing more than secret integers on individual devices â€” and with no reversibility, unlike SIV.

Many people clearly prefer online options. It is easy to imagine many would likewise prefer internet voting, especially once shown how it can be even more secure than paper alternatives.

Yet, it is important to proceed with caution and prudence, giving new possibilities careful consideration instead of outright dismissal. By experimenting and thoughtfully engaging with the system, we can make informed decisions and avoid prematurely dismissing potentially transformative and valuable innovations.

Leveraging strong cryptography, currently used to safeguard national secrets and armaments, SIV offers an online election system with no single point of vulnerability, one in which everyone, including voters, can easily detect and transparently particiapate in remediating any attempts of attack.

To ensure relability, we can start by conducting pilot elections on a small scale, allowing us to identify and address any potential issues in a controlled environment before a full-scale deployment of the system.

SIV, thus, holds the power to greatly improve the voting process, as it creates a voter-verifiable election system that provides proofs of correctness or corruption and is easily accessible to every citizen.
