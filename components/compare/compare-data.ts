              In SIV elections, all votes are anonymously published after the election, which allows voters to use their unique Verification # to check if their vote was recorded correctly. 
              As everyone has access to the votes list, everyone is enable to perform recounts using simple spreadsheet tools. In addition, every device that views the election results page instantly performs its own recount, allowing thousands of automatic checks and quickly spotting any errors.
              To detect malware on device, voters can use multiple devices to make sure their vote was submitted correctly, much like scanning a QR code. This quick check can be done at the time of voting and it helps identify any errors immediately. 
              Anti-Malware Codes allow voters to check their vote via a secondary device using unique codes provided in a mailed invitation. This system not only offers protection against catching malware on the primary device, but also tracks and validates the number of voters performing secondary device checks, improving the overall integrity of voting results.

              SIV RLAs can be performed after results are published. Official and independent parties can gain very high statistical confidence in election outcomes by only sampling a small number of random voters and ask them to confirm their votes.
