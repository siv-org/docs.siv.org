## Verification Number

When you submit your vote, your device generates a unique, randomly generated secret Verification Number. This number acts as a personal tool that allows you to confirm, with complete certainty, that your vote was properly recorded and counted.

This method provides a higher level of assurance than paper elections, where you have limited opportunities for first-hand verification after casting your ballot. This is sometimes referred to as “End-to-End Voter Verifiability”.

After casting your ballot, you receive the Verification \# via email: <img src="/images/verification-num.png" style={{width: "50%" }} class="ml-5 shadow-lg shadow-sky-900/30 my-7"/>

At the end of the election when the list of votes is published, you can use your Verification \# to verify if your vote is in the list and if it is accurately recorded:

## Using Multiple Devices to Detect Malware

In order to provide extra layers of security against potential threats such as malware, SIV also provides a process you can quickly use on a second device to confirm your selections. See: [Mitigating Malware on Voter's Devices](/mitigating-attacks/malware). This method can help you personally double-check that your vote was not modified, but that it was cast as you intended.
