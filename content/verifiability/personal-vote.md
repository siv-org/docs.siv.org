## Verification Number

When you submit your vote, your device generates a unique, randomly generated secret Verification Number. This number acts as a personal tool that allows you to confirm, with complete certainty, that your vote was properly recorded and counted.

This method provides a higher level of assurance than paper elections, where you have limited opportunities for first-hand verification after casting your ballot. This is sometimes referred to as “End-to-End Voter Verifiability”, and in the Verification # provides the power of fast and easy check.

## 2nd Device Check

In order to provide an extra layer of security against potential threats such as malware, you can use a second device to confirm the Verification #. This way, you can ensure that your vote was cast correctly and that it is counted as intended.
