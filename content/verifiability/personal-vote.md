## Verification Number

When you submit your vote, your device generates a unique, randomly generated secret Verification Number. This number acts as a personal tool that allows you to confirm, with complete certainty, that your vote was properly recorded and counted.

This method provides a higher level of assurance than paper elections, where you have limited opportunities for first-hand verification after casting your ballot. This is sometimes referred to as “End-to-End Voter Verifiability”.

After casting your ballot, you receive the Verification \# via email: <img src="/images/verification-num.png" style={{width: "50%" }} class="ml-5 shadow-lg shadow-sky-900/30 my-7"/>

At the end of the election when the list of votes is published, you can use your Verification \# to verify if your vote is in the list and if it is accurately recorded:

## 2nd Device Check

In order to provide an extra layer of security against potential threats such as malware, you can use a second device to confirm your selections.

Once you submitted your choices, you scan a QR code with a 2nd device, ideally a different operating system, which will display your submitted selections.

This method can help you personally double-check that your vote was not modified, but that it was cast as you intended.
