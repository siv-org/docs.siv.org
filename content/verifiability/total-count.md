## Published Results: A New Level of Transparency In The Counting Process

In SIV elections, the full list of anonymized votes is published at the end of the election, offering a level of transparency not found in traditional paper elections.

With this information easily accessible, independent recounts are quick and straightforward, giving you the peace of mind that comes with personally checking that votes have been counted correctly.

## Verify Number of Votes vs. Number of Voters

You can confirm that the number of votes cast matches the expected number of voters who participated in the election by checking the list of anonymized votes.

## Recount Votes

With the list of anonymized votes available, you can use freely available spreadsheet tools to verify total vote count.

In addition, your device and every device that accesses the public election status page automatically conducts its own recount, creating thousands of independent verifications at no additional cost.

This way the total vote count can be quickly and easily redone by you and auditors using freely available spreadsheet tools.
