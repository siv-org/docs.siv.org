## A New Level of Transparency In The Counting Process

In SIV elections, the full list of anonymized votes is published at the end of the election, offering a level of transparency not found in traditional paper elections.

With this information easily accessible and with freely available spreadsheet tools, independent recounts are quick and straightforward to conduct.

In addition, your device and every device that accesses the public election status page automatically conducts its own recount, creating thousands of independent verifications at no additional cost.

You are now also able to verify that the number of votes cast matches the expected number of voters who participated in the election by checking the list of anonymized votes.
