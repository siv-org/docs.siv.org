## What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?

In cryptography, a Zero-Knowledge Proof allows one party to demonstrate to another that a certain statement is true, without revealing any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. This means that the verifier can verify the validity of the proof, without learning any additional information about the statement itself.

In other words, zero-knowledge proofs enable a prover to prove the authenticity of a statement to a verifier, without revealing any secret information to the verifier. This property is particularly useful in situations where the prover has some sensitive information that they don't want to share, but still want to demonstrate the validity of the information to the verifier.

Zero-knowledge proofs are used in various areas, such as cryptography and computer science, where they are used to protect privacy and secure transactions.

## Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Voting

SIV provides multiple Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to prove that an election is correctly conducted, that every vote was counted, and it all added up to one person winning with a particular total. ZKPs give the power of not having to give up the actual votes of any person, and yet, everyone can see that it was done correctly.

[Video of Amit Sahai](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxqM23U7EUgdW2C3zGGqO9-ujxi8D9EsAg), Computer Science PhD, is asked to explain the concept of zero-knowledge proofs to 5 different people.

ZKPs are provided in order to verify the correctness of Stage 4: Votes Shuffled for Anonymization and Stage 5: Votes Unlocked & Tallied.

Privacy Protectors, independent auditors, and voters can re-run the Zero Knowledge Proofs for Valid Shuffles and Valid Partial Decryptions, to ensure none of the encrypted votes were tampered with after they were received.
