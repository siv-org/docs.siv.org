## A Guide to Verifying SIV Votes

As a voter, being able to verify the legitimacy of our cities' or country's election results is crucial to prevent corruption, loss of public trust, and civil unrest.

Throughout history, contested elections have led to violence and system breakdowns. For example, contested results in the 2007 presidential election in Kenya resulted in over 1,300 people killed and over 500,000 displaced. A similar scenario is documented in 2009 Iran, 2010 Ivory Coast, 2017 Kenya, or 2019 Bolivia.

In the United States, the 2000 Presidential election between George Bush and Al Gore led to violence due to disputed results. In 2020, the Biden vs Trump election also saw great violence, with millions of people not trusting the election results and some even storming the Capitol.

Voting is supposed to be one of the most beautiful and meaningful collective actions we can take. We get to decide how our world is governed and who gets to represent us. However, for some, it has become a time of fear, causing them to avoid being outside. For others, it is a time of dread, as they are reminded that the world they live in is led by people who may have attained their position of power through corrupt means.

This pain that people experience during election season is largely due to the fact that they lack the ability to confirm the legitimacy of the election results.

We need to have the ability to _personally verify_ the legitimacy of election results to protect our fundamental right to make our voices count. That's why Secure Internet Voting (SIV) was created as an independently verifiable digital election system.

This guide will explain how each voter can verify the legitimacy of Secure Internet Voting (SIV) elections and ensure that their own vote was accurately recorded and counted in the final election tally.
