The figures presented are for illustrative purposes only. The key takeaway is that while the percentage of votes received by candidates in relation to one another may not fluctuate greatly, the absolute number of votes they receive should increase. This is a positive development for all candidates, as it indicates growth in overall voter engagement.

Comparing relative percentages implies a zero-sum game, with winners and losers. However, when comparing absolute numbers, the outcome with SIV can be mutually beneficial for all candidates.
