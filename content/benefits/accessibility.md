title: Accessibility for Voters with Disabilities
---

SIV works exceptionally well for voters with disabilities as votes can be securely sent from votersâ€™ own devices. Therefore, people no longer need to travel to polling places or drop boxes.

SIV works in all web browsers and builds on W3C Standards, leveraging decades of work poured into Digital Accessibility.

Voters with disabilities can use their own devices in their own homes, with their own preferences for Text-to-Speech, Larger Font Sizes, High Contrast Mode, and other Accessibility options.
