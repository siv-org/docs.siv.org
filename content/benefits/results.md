title: Faster Election Results

SIV allows for the efficient and rapid tallying and publication of votes. Results can be made available within seconds of the voting period ending.

While this provides an unprecedented level of speed and transparency, it is important to note that in large-scale elections, it is advised to allow time for appropriate remediation processes before announcing final winners.

Nevertheless, SIV offers a significant advantage in terms of the speed of the overall voting process, regardless of the scale of the election.
