According to a report produced by [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://electionlab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2022-05/TheCostofConductingElections-2022.pdf) the cost of conducting elections has been shown to range from $2 billion to $6 billion yearly.

The implementation of Secure Internet Voting (SIV) has the potential to significantly decrease these costs, thereby saving billions of dollars of taxpayer funds.

Preliminary assessments have shown that the implementation of SIV can result in a substantial decrease in costs, with reductions of between 80% and 90%.
