Using SIV, voters are able to access the voting process with far greater language accessibility than ever before.

Because SIV runs in web browsers, it allows for the integration of easily accessible translation tools. These tools enable translations into hundreds of languages, providing unprecedented levels of accessibility and inclusivity.

This empowers more individuals to participate in the democratic process, and it also frees Election Administrators from the need to determine which languages ballots should be translated into.
