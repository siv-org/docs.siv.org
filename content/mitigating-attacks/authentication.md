part: Post Election Verification
title: Election Scenario

In order to provide a clear demonstration, we will narrate a hypothetical election and subsequently undergo a post-election verification process. This process will serve as an example of how post-election verification can be conducted by voters and auditors.

- Number of voters, all using SIV: 15
- Question: Who should be president, George Washington or Abraham Lincoln?

Due to the relatively small number of voters in this election, all 15 participants will act as Verifying Observers, so that they will all shuffle and do not need to trust each other to ensure privacy.

**Step 1 of the election**

As one of the voters, I receive my Voter Auth Token via an invitation email.

**Step 2**

I submit an encrypted vote for Abraham Lincoln.

**Step 3**

I am emailed a submission receipt, with my encrypted vote, cryptographically signed by SIV.

After a minute, all 15 encrypted votes have been submitted.

**Step 4**

We close the election, shuffle and then unlock the votes.

**Step 5**

Final results are:

- 10: George Washington
- 5: Abraham Lincoln

Because my preferred candidate lost, I am unhappy with the results and I suspect fraud. Therefore, I wish to challenge the election results.
