title: Weaknesses of Current Paper Voting Options
---

Representative governments derive their power from votes. Therefore, it is essential that our election infrastructure is as robust and reliable as possible.

Currently, there are multiple challenges many of us, voters, experience during and after election time:

## Doubt in Results

When there is widespread doubt about the accuracy of election results, it undermines the trust of the people in their government and threatens the stability of our free society.

This lack of trust is often fueled by a lack of transparency in the vote-tallying process, leading to millions of voters calling for better verification. It is important to address these concerns about the accuracy and fairness of election results, regardless of who emerges victorious.

This is because in the past, both parties have cried foul after their preferred candidates lost, with Democrats raising concerns in 2000 and 2004 and Republicans doing so in 2020.

Without addressing these fundamental issues, skepticism about the fairness of elections will persist, eroding the legitimacy of our democratic system.

## Accessibility

Pandemics like COVID-19 make in-person voting unfeasible.

Long lines and other personal responsibilities make it difficult for people to find the time to go to the polls. And poor accessibility is often disproportionately experienced by marginalized communities.

Voting can also be particularly challenging for individuals with disabilities, who face barriers such as lack of accessible polling locations or voting equipment.

Vote-by-mail may be a promising alternative, but it is unfamiliar especially to younger voters who do not often use snail mail.

The postal system also presents its own challenges, including the potential for delays and the risk of lost or [tampered ballots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_censorship).

## Exorbitant Annual Elections Budgets

Governments allocate on average $25 per voter towards each election, regardless of whether or not the individual casts their ballot.

​​The recent report by the Election Infrastructure Initiative (EII) that aimed to estimate state and local costs to conduct elections over the next decade came up with a national figure of $53.3 billion, which is broadly consistent with the cost of past elections, when converted to an annual basis (i.e., $5.3 billion).

The current state is that every year, billions of taxpayer dollars are funneled into processes that are labor-intensive and subject to human error, vulnerable to undetected fraud, and less accessible to some voters

## Dominance of a Handful of Closed-Source Corporations

The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that a limited number of closed-source corporations hold a monopoly on running American elections. This allows a select few companies to profit from the democratic process, while the general public is left to pay for subpar voting systems and bear the burden of an inadequate electoral experience.
