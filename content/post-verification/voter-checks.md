title: Checks Voters Can Perform
---

### 1st Check ✅

I, the voter, can use a 2nd device to check my Verification # to confirm that my own vote is correctly cast.

### 2nd Check ✅

I can confirm that the number of votes cast matches my expectations of the number of voters. In this case, 15 votes cast exactly equals 15 voters.

### 3rd Check ✅

Voter recounts the votes to confirm that the results do add up to 10-to-5 for Washington.

### 4th Check ✅

Voter re-runs the ZK-Proofs for Valid Shuffles and Valid Partial Decryptions, to ensure none of the encrypted votes were tampered with after they were received.
