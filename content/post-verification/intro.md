title: Intro
---

The goals of this section are:

1. To answer the question "If _I_ have just taken part in an election, how can I prove myself whether the results were legitimate?"
2. To answer the question "How can I be sure a close election that has now finished is legitimate?"
3. What are the Zero Knowledge Proofs and how are they useful?

// did only legitimate voters vote and only once?

// did all votes make it in the final tally?

// was the final tally added up correctly?
