**Election Administrators Can Print Submitted Votes per Ballots Onto Paper Ballots**

The third Post-Verification method enables election administrators to audit and track individual votes, even after the election has concluded.

The SIV Admin software includes a function that automatically converts digital votes into paper ballots in the form of a PDF document. Each generated vote is stamped with a unique Voter Verification #, thus preserving the privacy of the vote.

The ability to generate paper ballots from digital votes allows election administrators to seamlessly integrate SIV votes into their overall collection of votes.
